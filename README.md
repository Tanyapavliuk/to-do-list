# to-do-list
The web application for task list management.  
There is an opportunity to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

I used the React, and react-bootstrap libraries to create a user interface and Redux to manage the application state. 
Also used nanoid for creating unique IDs for new tasks, redux-persist for saving information to local storage, formik for creating form adding and editing, and yup for validation title of the form.
